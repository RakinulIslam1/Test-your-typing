            <p class="text-xl">
                <span class="text-white font-semibold">Answer:</span> LocalStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that with sessionStorage ,
                the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With localStorage , the data is persisted until the user
                manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the data.

            <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3 font-semibold text-white">Question 2: Difference between local scope and block scope</h1>
            <p class="text-xl">
                <span class="text-white font-semibold">Answer:</span> The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements if conditions or for
                loops, don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the
                same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords.

            <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3 font-semibold text-white">Question 3: How javascript event loop works</h1>
            <p class="text-xl">
                <span class="text-white font-semibold">Answer:</span> The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
                Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
                an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

            <p class="text-xl">
                <span class="text-white font-semibold">Answer:</span> There are some types of undefine in js such as a variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the
                variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not
                returned.etc
